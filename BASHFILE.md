    Create a bash script file with the .sh extension. For example, my_script.sh.

    Add a shebang line at the beginning of the script to specify the interpreter. In this case, we will use bash.

bash

#!/bin/bash

    Write your script commands under the shebang line. Each command should be on a new line. For example, let's print "Hello, World!" and list the files in the current directory.

bash

#!/bin/bash


echo "Hello, World!"


ls

    Save your script file.

    Open a terminal and navigate to the directory where your script file is located.

    Give the script file execute permissions by running the following command:

bash

chmod +x my_script.sh

    Now you can run your script by executing the following command:

bash

./my_script.sh

This will execute your script and display the output in your terminal.

Remember to replace my_script.sh with the actual name of your script file.
